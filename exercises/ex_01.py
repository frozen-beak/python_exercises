# Metadata
- Level: 1
- Title: Hello World

# Instructions
Write a function called `hello()` that returns the string "Hello, World!".

# How to Test
Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_ex_01
```

# Hint
- If you're stuck, try using the `return` keyword followed by the required string.
- Functions in Python use `return` keyword to return a value from the function.
- String literals in Python can be enclosed in either single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").

# Notes
- Do not remove or rename `hello()`, it's required and should not be altered
- You can create your own functions and call them inside the `hello()` function

# TODO: Implement the hello() function
def hello():
    pass  # Replace this 'pass' with your implementation
