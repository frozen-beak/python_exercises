- Title: Numbers divisible by 7 but not 5
- Topics: Loops, Conditionals, List Comprehension

# Instructions
Write a function called `find_numbers(min, max)` to find all integers(+ve and -ve) which are 
multiples of 7 but are natural numbers(only +ve) and are not multiples of 5, between the 
given range of `min` and `max` (both included). Return a list of these numbers.

# How to Test
Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_ex_02
```

# Hints
- Use a loop or list comprehension to check each number in the range
- Use the modulo operator (%) to check divisibility
- Don't forget to return the list of numbers

# Notes
- Do not remove or rename `find_numbers()`, it's required and should not be altered
- You can create your own helper functions if needed
- Make sure to handle cases where min > max properly
